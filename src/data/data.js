    about:   `Hello, and welcome, I am chiruhas 23, living in San José  California, I am a graduate student at San José State University, majoring in software engineering with a concentrated specialization in Enterprise Software Technologies. I am actively looking for a Software Development Internship.\n

More than a developer, I am a problem solver, I identify problems around me and try to come up with a solution with the tools I have at my disposal, this includes all the programming languages and various frameworks that are built on top of it.\n

Even before I started programming, I was curious about how various systems were developed and the way they interact with each other to give a final output that is so robust. So, naturally, learning about them has been a huge motivating factor for me. Moreover, every new technology I learned so far now feels like pieces of a huge puzzle, though the pieces I have are comparatively small but I have an overall understanding of what the entire puzzle is, and that itself adds a whole sense of direction for a career like that of a developer.\n

If there's one thing I strive for, that is being an irreplaceable asset for the company I work for, building up that level of skill is what keeps me up at night and drives me on the days when I feel like procrastinating. Currently, I am practicing and re-learning Data Structures & Algorithms and preparing for interviews for the role of an SDE intern.\n

Apart from programming, I am also interested in Finance, I regularly read about it, and explore various investment opportunities, I also invest my money across various segments, to grow my money alongside me. Consequently I am always on the lookout for various streams of passive income for which I spend some time researching about them.\n

I use this website as a platform to showcase my skills and projects many of my projects are open source if you find any project interesting or want to collaborate on a project, I am open and you can connect me via any options listed on this site.\n

When I'm not working or studying I love cooking food ❤️, going out on long drives, exercising, or playing on my Xbox, all of them help me to recalibrate myself. These are some of the most frequent things I do daily, and I do stick to a schedule so that I don't waste my time thinking about what to do. \n

P.S.  I could tell you a joke about UDP but I don't know if you would get it.\n

            description: 'In the last two decades there have been a widespread ascent in ecological difficulties being looked at by urban areas and nations internationally. In India, challenges identified with air contamination, squander the executives, shortage of water, protection of standard assets, and loss of biodiversity have been expanding. To oblige our expanding population, immense zones that once had tree cover have been deforested. In recent years, unnatural weather changes and forest fires have essentially influenced woodland cover in different pieces of the world. It is getting extremely hard to appropriately survey the harm to the vegetation, even with satellite imagery. An answer for this issue lies in distinguishing the measure of vegetation of a district utilizing satellite images which are then used to ascertain the green space of the land. This measurement can then measure up to the past green space of the area to survey the harm. The system being proposed takes satellite images of a region. Using computer vision, it calculates the percentage of vegetation or forest cover on land using color recognition in HSV color space. The proposed approach measures the green area by creating a mask of the satellite image using the lower and upper bounds of the HSV color space of the green color. Then, the procedure is followed by applying a morphological transformation of dilation on the image followed by bitwise AND operation between the original image and the mask to specifically detect only the green and shades of green and discard other colors. Using this system, changes in the vegetation area over a period can be estimated.\n' +

            title: 'Geospatial Based Thunder Storm Alert System',
            description: 'In recent years, natural calamities and disasters have increased day by day and people have suffered the consequences of them, one of the primary reasons being the unavailability of proper information which can be reached to people. GoogleMaps is growing rapidly due to the rise in devices that can take advantage of geospatial information, namely GPS enabled devices. The universality of handheld computing devices has been found to be especially efficient and effective in conducting disaster management and relief operations, so an application is in need which can alert users when there is a natural calamity in their vicinity so the users of that application can take appropriate measures to save themselves and reduce the dependence on search and rescue teams during a calamity because their expertise can be used elsewhere, such an application eliminates the need for rescue because the users are provided with alerts if they are in a calamity zone, so users can be aware of the danger they are in and take necessary measures. The natural calamity focused here is thunderstorms and lightning. The use of Smart phones has skyrocketed among people and developing an application that stays in the very mobile they use daily and also serves alerts people is a total lifesaver for many people, Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority (APSDMA) wants to provide this service over a Smart phone application. If the user is in a possible area of thunder strikes, this application can alert the user. This app provides alerts based upon the data provided by APSDMA.',
